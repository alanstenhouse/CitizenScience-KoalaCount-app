This document describes the app developed for use in the South Australian Great Koala Count 2 in November 2016.

The app was developed with LiveCode (www.livecode.com, open source version at: www.livecode.org). 

Note that there may be modifications to the code necessary to run on current versions of LiveCode.

Project partners included the Discovery Circle at UniSA, Adelaide University, South Australian Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources (DEWNR), Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges Natural Resources Management Board, 891 ABC Adelaide and Scruff Monkey Productions Ltd.

This software is available under the CC-BY licence.

It is written in LiveCode and will need to be modified to be of use in other Citizen Science projects.

Note that uploading of data requires an available server and permissions with scripts to process the data. You can also write these scripts using LiveCode.
Uploading of images used FTP at the time, but this can also be easily modified.
